## What is CDF?
CDF is the <b style="color: #A0010F">C</b>umulative <b style="color: #A0010F">D</b>istribution <b style="color: #A0010F">F</b>unction. It is used in probability and statistics to calculate the distribution of cumulative probabilities. You can also look for the full and detailed definition on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function).

In probability and statistics, given a ***random-variable*** $X$ and a value $x$ we want to evaluate at, the **CDF** of $X$ is the probability that $X$ is less than or equal $x$.
