Hi, I'm Jason, currently a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au). 

I'm committed to the research of [Recommender System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#:~:text=A%20recommender%20system%2C%20or%20a,would%20give%20to%20an%20item.) algorithms. 

I'm honored to receive a full scholarship offered by the [Australia Research Council](https://www.arc.gov.au/), and to receive the 2018 and 2019 **Vice-Chancellor's List Award**, **First-Class Honours** Bachelor with **GPA 4.0/4.0**. 

More than 8 years of **PHP** development experience, 5 years of **IT programming training** experience.

I am going to write some articles about machine learning, deep learning and recommender system algorithms in this blog.

You can track me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonshere), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jie-jason-li-4a1003146/). If you want to email me, go ahead and send an email to [mrjasonedu@gmail.com](mailto:mrjasonedu@gmail.com).

## BACKGROUND

My original profession was web development, and I have more than 8 years of development experience in PHP development. I am currently entering the field of artificial intelligence and mainly researching recommendation system algorithms.

## INFORMATION OVERFLOW

I love to explore knowledge in **unknown fields**, such as **astronomy** and **quantum fields**. These areas are deeply attracted to me. And the limitation of human knowledge prompts us to spend more time on exploring. Maintain the awe of the universe, the awe of the laws of nature, and the desire for knowledge.
